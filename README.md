# Historical Occupations In Text
Material from the "Identifying Historical Occupations in Text using HISCO: A User-Centric Approach" project.

This project was initited during the Digital Humanities in Practice course at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, in the context of its Digital Humanities and Social Analytics minor. The group's primary aim was to develop a workflow that could parse through unstructed, historical texts and highlight occupations by matching separate words to databases such as the Historical International Standard of Classification of Occupations (HISCO).

In this repository are stored the following: 

1) The workflow, written in Python on a Jupyter notebook;

2) The original paper written for the Digital Humanities in Practice course;

3) The original poster presented at the end of the aforementioned course.
